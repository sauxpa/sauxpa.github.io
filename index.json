In the game of Astro though, the loss distribution for scratching a card is far from being Gaussian: it is discrete, asymmetrical, with pronounced skewness towards small losses. The figure below shows the difference between the true Astro distribution (in green) and its Gaussian approximation $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ (in blue), with $\\mu=0.63$ and $\\sigma=20.67$.\n  It is insightful to look at the empirical estimation of $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ under both the true Astro model and its Gaussian approximation. We define the standard (unbiased) sample estimators \\begin{align*} \u0026amp;\\widehat{\\mu}_t = \\frac{1}{t}\\sum_{s=1}^t X_s \\,,\\\\\n\u0026amp;\\widehat{\\sigma}^2_t = \\frac{1}{t-1}\\sum_{s=1}^t \\left(X_s - \\widehat{\\mu}_t\\right)^2 \\,, \\end{align*} and report below the median (25th - 75th percentile in shaded area) of 10 independent replications of $\\widehat{\\mu}_t$ and $\\widehat{\\sigma}_t$ for $t$ ranging from 2 to 4,500,000, where $X$ is sampled from the Astro distribution (in green) and the Gaussian approximation (in blue).\n  For the mean estimation, as expected, $\\widehat{\\mu}_t$ converges to the true expected value $\\mu=0.63$, with higher dispersion in the Gaussian case. For the variance estimation, $\\widehat{\\sigma}_t$ seems to converge quite fast to the true value $\\sigma=20.67$ in the Gaussian case, but remains much lower in the Astro model until $t\\approx 10^5$, before suddenly jumping to values around $\\widehat{\\sigma}_t\\approx 20$. This is actually quite intuitive: the high variance of the Astro distribution is driven by the outlier gains, in particular 1,000 and 25,000, which occur with very small probability. Before $t\\approx 10^5$, the samples $X_1, \\dots, X_t$ used in $\\widehat{\\sigma}_t$ do not contain such outliers, thus estimating a seemingly low variance. In other words, the sample variance in the Astro model is subject to higher variability than in the Gaussian case, which hints at larger higher order moments (skewness, kurtosis\u0026hellip;) in the Astro case.\nTBC License Copyright 2022-present Patrick Saux.\n","date":1663459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663492163,"objectID":"ce8cda6425ca51bd32692b8d805cf389","permalink":"https://sauxpa.github.io/post/astro_2/","publishdate":"2022-09-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/astro_2/","section":"post","summary":"Some vacation fun on gambling and martingales.","tags":[""],"title":"Gambler's ruin in Astro and the accuracy of Gaussian approximation [2]","type":"post"},{"authors":["Patrick Saux"],"categories":[""],"content":"Recently, I was on a holiday trip with a friend, let\u0026rsquo;s call him Nathan. While not exactly a gambling addict, Nathan likes to buy scratchcards every now and then. One of his favourites is called Astro; most newspapers shops in France sell them for €2 a piece, and there exists 12 different versions, one for each astrological sign. While the sign itself does not affect the odds (at least I don\u0026rsquo;t believe so), it is a brilliant marketing strategy as it encourages you to buy a few more tickets and distribute them to your friends born under a different star than yours. Nathan is a Sagittarius, and that day he acquired a set of tickets, including an extra Aquarius one that he gifted to me. As it turned out, all but one of the set were loosers, the Aquarius one being the sole winner of a modest €6. Emboldened by this unexpected luck, I exchanged my gains for three more tickets to distribute among friends, keeping one Aquarius for myself. Again, all loosers but mine. This time I cashed out and stopped the gambling streak, much to Nathan\u0026rsquo;s dismay. I admit this is not a particularly exciting vacation story, but it got me thinking: what if I did not cashed out? How long could I have last by just reinvesting my gains, flying off Nathan\u0026rsquo;s initial €2 ticket?\nThe Astro distribution Astro is a fairly transparent game: whoever takes the time to read the back of a ticket can learn all there is to know about the odds and possible profits. On mine, it read that 4,500,000 tickets were issued, among which 661,500 are winners for €2, 476,000 for €4, 150,000 for €6, 101,350 for €10, 45,000 for €20, 415 for €17T00, 8 for €1,000 and finally 3 extra lucky ones for €25,000. The figure below shows this gain distribution, with probabilities displayed in logarithmic scale for readability.\n  The expected gain of a ticket chosen uniformly at random (which I assume is how tickets are assigned to vendors) can be easily calculated from the above information and reads $\\mathbb{E}[gain] = \\sum_{x} x\\mathbb{P}(gain=x) = 1.37$. After substracting the €2 cost of a ticket, the expected net payoff of a single Astro ticket is then $-0.63$. This makes perfect sense: the company that issues these tickets makes 63 cents on each, i.e about €2.3m in total.\nIn addition, we can also compute the variance with the formula $\\sigma^2 = \\mathbb{E}[gain^2] - \\mathbb{E}[gain]^2$, which gives $\\sigma\\approx 20.67$.\nFlight time Going back to our initial question: how long can we defy the odds and keep \u0026ldquo;flying\u0026rdquo; from only the initial investment of €2? Let\u0026rsquo;s introduce some notations. We denote by $\\left( g_t \\right)_{t\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ a sequence of i.i.d samples drawn from the Astro distribution and let $\\xi_t = 2 - g_t$ be the corresponding net loss, including the ticket price, and $$ X_t = \\sum_{s=1}^t \\xi_s $$ be the cumulative loss process. The more $X_t$ increases, the more losses the gambler suffers.\nNote that the i.i.d assumption does not exactly hold: once a ticket is bought and scratched, it is removed from the pool of available tickets and cannot be acquired again, i.e. the true sampling is without replacement. We will see later that this only has a limited impact on the final result, which is quite intuitive: if you draw only a few samples, say a few dozens at most, with replacement, it is quite unlikely that you would sample twice the same among the $N=4,500,000$.\nOur problem of \u0026ldquo;flight time\u0026rdquo; corresponds to studying the following random time: $$ \\tau_{\\alpha} = \\inf \\left\\lbrace t\\in\\mathbb{N}, X_t \\geq \\alpha \\right\\rbrace, $$ which is a stopping time with respect to the natural filtration $\\left(\\mathcal{F}_t\\right)_{t\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ induced by the process $X$, i.e. $\\mathcal{F}_t=\\sigma\\left( X_s, 0\\leq s\\leq t\\right)$ (this means $\\left\\lbrace \\tau_{\\alpha} \\geq t\\right\\rbrace$ is an event in $\\mathcal{F}_t$ for all $t\\in\\mathbb{N}$, i.e. one knows from the information available at time $t$ whether or not the stopping event occured or not). Indeed, reaching the threshold $\\alpha=2$ for the cumulative loss $X_t$ is equivalent to reaching €0 wealth for a gambler who starts at €2 and keeps scratching Astro at every round, which we informally defined as the \u0026ldquo;flight time\u0026rdquo; above.\nThe Gaussian case The reader versed in martingales will almost surely recognise this problem as an instance of gambler\u0026rsquo;s ruin. Indeed, the distribution of $\\tau_{\\alpha}$ can be fully explicited when the increments $\\xi$ are Gaussian. For completeness, we derive below this standard result using stochastic calculus.\nFor convenience, we consider the continuous time setting, i.e. $t\\in\\mathbb{R}_+$ instead of $t\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and define the process $Z$ as \\begin{align*} \u0026amp;dZ_t = \\mu dt + \\sigma dW_t\\,,\\\\\n\u0026amp;Z_0=0\\,, \\end{align*} where $\\mu=0.63$, $\\sigma=20.67$ and $W$ is a standard Brownian motion with respect to the filtration $\\mathcal{F}$. Intuitively, we retrieve the discrete time model by the correspondence $dt\\approx 1$ and $dW_t \\approx \\xi_t$. The loss process $Z$ can be more directly expressed as $$ Z_t = \\mu t + \\sigma W_t\\,, $$ and the flight time in this context naturally becomes $\\tau_{\\alpha} = \\inf \\left\\lbrace t\\in\\mathbb{N}, Z_t \\geq \\alpha \\right\\rbrace$.\nOf martingales and stopping times Studying a stopping time can be quite hard, and coupling it with the right martingale is often the easiest approach. We recall here some basics results on the interplay between martingales and stopping times. For convenience, we denote by $\\mathcal{T}$ either $\\mathbb{N}$ or $\\mathbb{R}_+$ (the elementary results presented here are essentially unchanged by moving to the continuous time setting).\nFirst, a process $\\left(M_t\\right)_{t\\in\\mathcal{T}}$ is a martingale with respect to a filtration $\\left(\\mathcal{F}_t\\right)_{t\\in\\mathcal{T}}$ if for all $t\\in\\mathcal{T}$, $M_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}t$-adapted, integrable and satisfies the equality $$ \\forall s\\in\\mathcal{T},\\ \\mathbb{E}\\left[M{t+s}\\mid \\mathcal{F}_t\\right] = M_t\\,. $$\nIntuitively, this means a martingale represents a fair game: it uses only information available at time $t$ ($\\mathcal{F}_t$-adapted), and given this information, the estimation of future values of $M$ is exactly the current known value $M_t$ (this property is sometimes referred to as martingales being \u0026ldquo;constant in expectation\u0026rdquo;).\nThe crucial property of martingales for the study of stopping times is called Doob\u0026rsquo;s optional stopping theorem: for any $\\mathcal{F}$-stopping time, the stopped process $\\left(M_{t\\wedge \\tau}\\right)_{t\\in\\mathcal{T}}$ is also a $\\mathcal{F}$-martingale, where $t\\wedge \\tau$ represents the minimum between $t$ and $\\tau$. By taking the expectation of the above equality applied to the stopped martingale, we obtain the following identity: $$ \\forall t\\in\\mathcal{T},\\ \\mathbb{E}\\left[M_{t\\wedge \\tau}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[M_0\\right]\\,. $$\nIdeally, we would like to have the simpler equality $\\mathbb{E}\\left[M_{\\tau}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[M_0\\right]$ instead, which depending on the exact expression of $M$ can reveal key properties of $\\tau$ (expectation or higher moments, density function\u0026hellip;). It is therefore tempting to take the limit $t\\rightarrow +\\infty$ in the above and hope that one can swap limit and expectation. This holds under a variety of technical assumptions. A simple argument, which is enough for our purpose, is to use the dominated convergence theorem, provided $M_{t\\wedge \\tau}$ can be bounded by an integrable random variable independent of $t$.\nBuilding the right martingale For $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}$, we define $$ M^\\lambda_t = \\exp\\left( \\lambda W_t - \\frac{\\lambda^2}{2}t\\right)\\,. $$ It is a standard result in stochastic calculus that $M^\\lambda$ defines a $\\mathcal{F}$-martingale (it follows from the expression of the moment generating function on the standard Gaussian distribution coupled with the fact that the law of $W_t$ is $\\mathcal{N}\\left(0, t\\right)$). Moreover, it can be rewritten as $M^\\lambda_t = \\exp\\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sigma} Z_t - (\\frac{\\lambda^2}{2} + \\frac{\\lambda \\mu}{\\sigma})t\\right)$. The reason why this is the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; martingale will become apparent soon: it will help us compute exponential moments of $\\tau_{\\alpha}$, also known as the Laplace transform, which fully characterises its distribution.\nNote that $t\\mapsto Z_t$ is (almost-surely) continuous (since $t\\mapsto W_t$ is), and therefore $Z_{\\tau_{\\alpha}}=\\alpha$ on the event $\\left\\lbrace \\tau_{\\alpha} \u0026lt; \\infty\\right\\rbrace$. As a consequence, it is straightforward to control $M^{\\lambda}_{t\\wedge \\tau_{\\alpha}}$ in the following way: $$ \\lvert M^\\lambda_{t\\wedge \\tau_{\\alpha}} \\rvert \\leq e^{\\frac{\\lambda}{\\sigma} \\max(Z_{t\\wedge \\tau_{\\alpha}}, 0) } \\leq e^{\\frac{\\lambda \\alpha}{\\sigma}}\\,, $$ which allows to use the dominated convergence theorem as discussed above. Thereofore, Doob\u0026rsquo;s optional stopping theorem yields: $$ \\mathbb{E}[M^\\lambda_{\\tau_{\\alpha}}]=\\mathbb{E}[e^{\\frac{\\lambda \\alpha}{\\sigma} - (\\frac{\\lambda^2}{2} + \\frac{\\lambda \\mu}{\\sigma})\\tau_{\\alpha}}]=1\\,. $$ After rearranging termes, we obtain the identity $$ \\mathbb{E}[e^{-(\\frac{\\lambda^2}{2} + \\frac{\\lambda \\mu}{\\sigma})\\tau_{\\alpha}}] = e^{-\\frac{\\lambda \\alpha}{\\sigma}}\\,. $$ This is almost the Laplace transform of $\\tau_{\\alpha}$, which we define for $\\beta\u0026gt;0$ as $\\mathbb{E}[e^{-\\beta \\tau_{\\alpha}}]$. Since $\\tau_{\\alpha}$ is nonnegative, this Laplace transform fully characterises its distribution. Solving $\\beta = \\frac{\\lambda^2}{2} + \\frac{\\lambda \\mu}{\\sigma}$ in terms of $\\lambda$ yields $\\lambda=-\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu^2}{\\sigma^2} + 2\\beta}$ for $\\lambda\\geq 0$, i.e. $$ \\mathbb{E}[e^{-\\beta \\tau_{\\alpha}}] = e^{\\frac{\\alpha \\mu}{\\sigma^2}\\left(1 - \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2\\sigma^2 \\beta}{\\mu^2}}\\right)} \\,. $$\nBesides characterising the distribution, the Laplace transform is also useful to compute the moments. Indeed, by differentiating w.r.t. $\\beta$, we have that $$ -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\mathbb{E}[e^{-\\beta \\tau_{\\alpha}}]\\bigg|_{\\beta=0} = \\mathbb{E}[\\tau_{\\alpha}] = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\mu}\\,. $$\nAfter all these calculations, let\u0026rsquo;s take a step back to reflect on what this result means. On average, a gambler reaches the critical threshold $\\alpha=2$ after $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\mu}=\\frac{2}{0.63}\\approx 3.17$ rounds. This is, perhaps quite surprisingly, very intuitive: if you start from €2 and loose on average $63$ cents each time you play, it should take you a bit more than 3 rounds to consume your initial €2. The above shows that this back-of-the-envelope calculation is exact in the continuous time Gaussian case. Moreover, this result is independent of the variance $\\sigma^2$.\nNice! Does this mean that I can play thrice at the cost of a single ticket most of the time? Not at all! It is important to make the distinction here between mean and median flight times. Intuitively, the distribution of flight time $\\tau_{\\alpha}$ should be quite asymmetrical around its mean: events where large gains are made early (e.g. first ticket yields €100) will result in very large flight times but remain quite rare, while events of \u0026ldquo;early crashes\u0026rdquo; (the first few tickets are loosers) are much more frequent. Therefore, the median flight time, i.e. the majority of flight times are below it, should be less than the mean flight time, which is driven upwards by the \u0026ldquo;early luck\u0026rdquo; outliers. This type of distribution is called *right-skewed*.\nFlight time distribution in the Gaussian case The expression of the Laplace transform $\\mathbb{E}[e^{-\\beta \\tau_{\\alpha}}]$ reveals that $\\tau_{\\alpha}$ follows an Inverse Gaussian distribution $IG\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\mu}, \\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right)$, the density of which is given by: $$ p_{\\tau_{\\alpha}}(t) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha^2}{2\\pi \\sigma^2 t^3}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\left(\\mu t - \\alpha\\right)^2}{2\\sigma^2 t} \\right)\\,. $$\nWe plot below this density for the Astro parameters ($\\mu=0.63, \\sigma=20.67, \\alpha=2$), as well as the mean, the median, and the 5th, 25th, 75th and 95th percentiles. This distribution appears to be significantly right-skewed: even the 95th percentile is below the mean ($2.14$ versus $3.17$). In other words, according to the Gaussian approximation, it is really unlikely (less than 5% chance) that your flight time will be above 2 rounds, even though the mean flight time is above 3!\n  What\u0026rsquo;s next? Next time, we will talk about the flight time for the true Astro distribution, rather than under the Gaussian approximation. Closed-form expression of $\\tau_{\\alpha}$ are not available in this case, so simulations will prove handy.\nLicense Copyright 2022-present Patrick

Back then, we used to think in terms of networks of individuals subject to diseases that spread among neighbors, but more realistic application domains were thought to be computer malwares or viral marketing online. Obviously times have changed, and with several weeks of lockdown ahead, I thought about revisiting some of this work in the light of the recent events.\nThis article aims to describe a simple model to simulate random disease outbreaks and provide empirical evidence of the role of the network topology. In layman\u0026rsquo;s terms, the sparser the network, such as one describing a population under lockdown, the slower the propagation and the flatter the epidemic peak.\nThis post is intended to be fairly non-technical. All experiments shown are based on numerical models and do not claim to accurately represent real-life epidemics. All the code (a small Python library and a few notebooks) and more detailed mathematical explanations can be found HERE.\nWhy stochastic models? The use of randomness to simulate complex systems is ubiquitous in mathematics, engineering and sciences in general. The general principle is to build an engine to generate plausible scenarios for the evolution of the system and sample multiple independent realisations to study the average or extreme behaviours.\nBefore we move on to such models, let us briefly recall some standard deterministic models in epidemiology. These are called compartmental models, because they model the evolution of a patient as going through successive stages, or compartments. Three popular variants of this idea are :\n  Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) : all patients are initially susceptible, then can be infected, and then are removed from the system (either they are fully immune or they died),\n  Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) : same but patients can be infected multiple times,\n  Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) : similar to SIR, with an extra compartment to model incubation time, during which patient are not yet infectious.\n  Under mean-field assumptions, i.e every individual in a large population shares the same likelihood of being infected by the rest, one can derive a deterministic system of differential equations describing the evolution of the fraction of infected individuals (see for example Kephart \u0026amp; White).\nWhile such models are easy to understand and scale very well, they lack any description of the fine structure of the underlying social network. For example, what if the network contains highly social individuals that may act as hubs for the propagation?\nMarkov models A large class of popular stochastic models follow the Markov property : the future evolution depends only on the present state, not the past history. While debatable, it allows for very flexible still numerically tractable models.\nConsider a network G, that is a list of individuals (for instance 1, \u0026hellip;, N) and a list of pairs (i, j) if individuals i and j are neighbors. We will stick to this simple framework, but generalisation to weighted or directed networks is straightforward.\nSIS, SIR and SEIR can be naturally translated to the language of Markov processes by specifying the probability of transition between compartments. As is customary with continuous-time processes, we will actually define the transition rates rather than the probability (the two are related by the fact that transition events follow exponential distributions with parameters equal to the transition rates).\nFor any individual, we assume a transition susceptible -\u0026gt; infected (or susceptible -\u0026gt; exposed in SEIR) at rate proportional to the number of infected neighbors. This is quite natural: the more one is surrounded by infectious people, the riskier (note that here again there is room for more complicated designs by using a nonlinear aggregation function over the neighbors). The other transitions, (I-\u0026gt;S in SIS, I-\u0026gt;R in SIR, E-\u0026gt;I and I-\u0026gt;R in SEIR) are assumed to occur at constant rates (think of it as sick people being put in isolation).\nExperiments SIR First let us simulate the effect of a severe lockdown in SIR. For that, we compare the evolution of the number of cases for the same epidemic (same transition rates parameters) on two different regular networks :\n sparse: every node is connected to 10 other nodes, dense: every node is connected to 100 other nodes.  In the sparse scenario, a typical outbreak has a long plateau and a slow decrease, but a much smaller peak. In the dense case, almost all the population gets infected at a very early stage, creating a sharp peak, followed by a brutal, but slower decrease. The blue curve below is a typical lockdown strategic goal (flat and slow) while the red curve is more inline with a herd immunity viewpoint.\n  To be a bit more quantitative about the shape of the curve, one can try to regress a parametric form on it. In all experiments, sparse SIR leads to an approximately normal form while dense SIR is better fitted by a skewed shape such as lognormal. In other words, network sparsification is not just about flattening the curve, but also controlling the slope.\nHub effect Another empirical effect is the Hub effect, which is that highly connected nodes are critical for propagation. This typically happens in social networks (a few very popular nodes attract most of the attention) and can be described as preferential attachment networks: starting from a small population of nodes, a larger network is grown by adding follower nodes that connect to the existing ones with probability proportional to the number of already existing neighbors.\nIn the case of SIS over a preferential attachment network, we compare two outbreak scenarios:\n a single patient zero, the one with the most neighbors, 5 patient zeros, drawn at random (and therefore likely to be follower nodes).  Unless a hub is targeted, the epidemic usually dies fast without reaching highly-connected zones, even with more initial patients.\n  Comparison with deterministic models As argued above, deterministic models à la Kephart \u0026amp; White can be seen as scaling limits of Markov models on regular networks, i.e when the local structure of the network is the same everywhere one looks.\nThis is indeed empirically validated, see for example in the case of SIR and SIS below.\n  SIR    SIS  Comparison with real data (as of April 2020) This is still a work-in-progress, made practically difficult by the number and quality of available data. One interesting direction would be to fit one of these models (for example SEIR) to the curve of tested cases of COVID-19 (which is typically noisy and subject to bias, including periodic bias, for instance during the week-ends when medical staff are not tested).\nTo be clear, calibrating the model here means tuning the transition rates for S-\u0026gt;E, E-\u0026gt;I and I-\u0026gt;R such that the average curve over multiple epidemic scenarios resembles the most the collected data (for the example in the least squares sense).\nFrom there, one could investigate different types of representative networks to determine the ones that reproduce the best the observed trends, and use this as a starting point for further predictions (epidemic evolution, impact of lockdown exit\u0026hellip;).\n  Going further A very attractive aspect of stochastic simulation is the ability to perform numerical experiments. However, the topic of random processes over networks has been studied a lot on the theoretical side as well. A few selected references include :\n  Virus Spreads in Networks by Van Mieghem et al., which formalises the definition of epidemic as a Markov process on the configuration space,\n  The Effect of Network Topology on the Spread of Epidemics by Massoulié et al., which exhibits a phase transition between short-lived and long-lived epidemics in terms of the transition rates and the adjacency spectral radius of the network,\n  Got the Flu (or Mumps)? Check the Eigenvalue! in the same spirit, which relates spectral properties of the network to critical epidemic regimes in different models.\n  Also check out this repo for more implementation details, including a Bokeh app to dynamically play with different network and epidemic parameters.\n  Enjoy!\nLicense Copyright 2020-present Patrick Saux.\n","date":1587686400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663415956,"objectID":"e2dfa803bac6d8a5d57eb3493bc5047c","permalink":"https://sauxpa.github.io/post/markov_epidemic/","publishdate":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/markov_epidemic/","section":"post","summary":"A humble lockdown project to model the interplay between the structure of a network and the spread of epidemics over it.","tags":[""],"title":"Markov Epidemic, a stochastic model for disease outbreak","type":"post"},{"authors":["Patrick Saux"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1579356461,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615369729,"objectID":"a063d64ba38a968c8b560c050d4f7f22","permalink":"https://sauxpa.github.io/projects/neural_exploration/","publishdate":"2020-01-18T15:07:41+01:00","relpermalink":"/projects/neural_exploration/","section":"projects","summary":"Analysis and implementation of neural approximator for contextual bandits and episodic MDP.","tags":[],"title":"Neural exploration","type":"projects"},{"authors":["Patrick Saux"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577887203,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615369729,"objectID":"ed9809f516f3af6869363134b70a4217","permalink":"https://sauxpa.github.io/projects/graph_embedding/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T15:00:03+01:00","relpermalink":"/projects/graph_embedding/","section":"projects","summary":"Theoretical and practical continuity of various graph embeddings (eigenmap, deep walk, graph kernels, random walk factorisation...)","tags":[],"title":"Continuity of Graph Embeddings","type":"projects"},{"authors":["Patrick Saux"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577282295,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615370361,"objectID":"7402895a941774a48bd56f9b52e5c8dd","permalink":"https://sauxpa.github.io/projects/optimal_transport_correlation/","publishdate":"2019-12-25T14:58:15+01:00","relpermalink":"/projects/optimal_transport_correlation/","section":"projects","summary":"Geometric study of correlation matrix via Frechet mean.","tags":[],"title":"Optimal Transport Correlation","type":"projects"},{"authors":["Patrick Saux"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1576417816,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615369729,"objectID":"233a42a9516aaf734380d600628218cc","permalink":"https://sauxpa.github.io/projects/connectivity-loss/","publishdate":"2019-12-15T14:50:16+01:00","relpermalink":"/projects/connectivity-loss/","section":"projects","summary":"Train robust autoencoder with topological loss.","tags":[],"title":"Connectivity Loss","type":"projects"},{"authors":["Patrick Saux"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1563113997,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615369729,"objectID":"f66b41ad514ffefa0c2cb0802684d851","permalink":"https://sauxpa.github.io/projects/fractal/","publishdate":"2019-07-14T15:19:57+01:00","relpermalink":"/projects/fractal/","section":"projects","summary":"Fractal generation in Python using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and Numba.","tags":[],"title":"Fractal","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612908990,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://sauxpa.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":["Patrick Saux","Sayak Ray Chowdhury","Odalric-Ambrym Maillard","Aditya Gopalan"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
