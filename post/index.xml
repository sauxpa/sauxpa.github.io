      <title>Gambler&#39;s ruin in Astro and the accuracy of Gaussian approximation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was on a holiday trip with a friend, let&amp;rsquo;s call him Nathan. While not exactly a gambling addict, Nathan likes to buy scratchcards every now and then. One of his favourites is called Astro; most newspapers shops in France sell them for €2 a piece, and there exists 12 different versions, one for each astrological sign. While the sign itself does not affect the odds (at least I don&amp;rsquo;t believe so), it is a brilliant marketing strategy as it encourages you to buy a few more tickets and distribute them to your friends born under a different star than yours. Nathan is a Sagittarius, and that day he acquired a set of tickets, including an extra Aquarius one that he gifted to me. As it turned out, all but one of the set were loosers, the Aquarius one being the sole winner of a modest €6. Emboldened by this unexpected luck, I exchanged my gains for three more tickets to distribute among friends, keeping one Aquarius for myself. Again, all loosers but mine. This time I cashed out and stopped the gambling streak, much to Nathan&amp;rsquo;s dismay. I admit this is not a particularly exciting vacation story, but it got me thinking: what if I did not cashed out? How long could I have last by just reinvesting my gains, flying off Nathan&amp;rsquo;s initial €2 ticket?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-astro-distribution&#34;&gt;The Astro distribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astro is a fairly transparent game: whoever takes the time to read the back of a ticket can learn all there is to know about the odds and possible profits. On mine, it read that 4,500,000 tickets were issued, among which 661,500 are winners for €2, 476,000 for €4, 150,000 for €6, 101,350 for €10, 45,000 for €20, 415 for €17T00, 8 for €1,000 and finally 3 extra lucky ones for €25,000. The figure below shows this gain distribution, with probabilities displayed in logarithmic scale for readability.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expected gain of a ticket chosen uniformly at random (which I assume is how tickets are assigned to vendors) can be easily calculated from the above information and reads $\mathbb{E}[gain] = \sum_{x} x\mathbb{P}(gain=x) = 1.37$. After substracting the €2 cost of a ticket, the expected net payoff of a single Astro ticket is then $-0.63$. This makes perfect sense: the company that issues these tickets makes 63 cents on each, i.e about €2.3m in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we can also compute the variance with the formula $\sigma^2 = \mathbb{E}[gain^2] - \mathbb{E}[gain]^2$, which gives $\sigma\approx 20.67$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;flight-time&#34;&gt;Flight time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to our initial question: how long can we defy the odds and keep &amp;ldquo;flying&amp;rdquo; from only the initial investment of €2? Let&amp;rsquo;s introduce some notations. We denote by $\left( g_t \right)_{t\in\mathbb{N}}$ a sequence of i.i.d samples drawn from the Astro distribution and let $\xi_t = 2 - g_t$ be the corresponding net &lt;em&gt;loss&lt;/em&gt;, including the ticket price, and
$$
X_t = \sum_{s=1}^t \xi_s
$$
be the cumulative loss process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the i.i.d assumption does not exactly hold: once a ticket is bought and scratched, it is removed from the pool of available tickets and cannot be acquired again, i.e. the true sampling is &lt;em&gt;without replacement&lt;/em&gt;. We will see later that this only has a limited impact on the final result, which is quite intuitive: if you draw only a few samples, say a few dozens at most, with replacement, it is quite unlikely that you would sample twice the same among the $N=4,500,000$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our problem of &amp;ldquo;flight time&amp;rdquo; corresponds to studying the following random time:
$$
\tau_{\alpha} = \inf \left\lbrace t\in\mathbb{N}, X_t \geq \alpha \right\rbrace,
$$
which is a stopping time with respect to the natural filtration $\left(\mathcal{F}_t\right)_{t\in\mathbb{N}}$ induced by the process $X$, i.e. $\mathcal{F}_t=\sigma\left( X_s, 0\leq s\leq t\right)$. Indeed, reaching the threshold $\alpha=2$ for the cumulative loss $X_t$ is equivalent to reaching €0 wealth for a gambler who starts at €2 and keeps scratching Astro at every round, which we informally defined as the &amp;ldquo;flight time&amp;rdquo; above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gaussian-case&#34;&gt;The Gaussian case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader versed in martingales will almost surely recognise this problem as an instance of gambler&amp;rsquo;s ruin. Indeed, the distribution of $\tau_{\alpha}$ can be fully explicited when the increments $\xi$ are Gaussian. For completeness, we derive below this standard result using stochastic calculus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For convenience, we consider the continuous time setting, i.e. $t\in\mathbb{R}_+$ instead of $t\in\mathbb{N}$ and define the process $Z$ as
\begin{align*}
&amp;amp;dZ_t = \mu dt + \sigma dW_t\,,\\&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp;Z_0=0\,,
\end{align*}
where $\mu=0.63$, $\sigma=20.67$ and $W$ is a standard Brownian motion with respect to the filtration $\mathcal{F}$. Intuitively, we retrieve the discrete time model by the correspondence $dt\approx 1$ and $dW_t \approx \xi_t$. The loss process $Z$ can be more directly expressed as
$$
Z_t = \mu t + \sigma W_t\,.
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying a stopping time can be quite hard, and coupling it with the right martingale is often the easiest approach. For $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$, we define
$$
M^\lambda_t = \exp\left( \lambda W_t - \frac{\lambda^2}{2}t\right)\,.
$$
It is a standard result that $M^\lambda$ defines a $\mathcal{F}$-martingale. Moreover, it can be rewritten as $M^\lambda_t = \exp\left( \frac{\lambda}{\sigma} Z_t - (\frac{\lambda^2}{2} + \frac{\lambda \mu}{\sigma})t\right)$. Note that $t\mapsto X_t$ is (almost-surely) continuous (since $t\mapsto W_t$ is), and therefore $Z_{\tau_{\alpha}}=\alpha$. Doob&amp;rsquo;s optional stopping theorem yields that the stopped martingale $\left(M^\lambda_{t \wedge \tau_{\alpha}}\right)_{t\in\mathbb{N}}$ is also a $\mathcal{F}$-martingale, and thus in particular
$$
\mathbb{E}[M^\lambda_{t \wedge \tau_{\alpha}}] = \mathbb{E}[M^\lambda_0] = 1\,.
$$
It is now tempting to consider the limit $t\rightarrow +\infty$ to obtain $\mathbb{E}[M^\lambda_{\tau_{\alpha}}]=\mathbb{E}[e^{\frac{\lambda \alpha}{\sigma} - (\frac{\lambda^2}{2} + \frac{\lambda \mu}{\sigma})\tau_{\alpha}}]=1$. This is justified since
$$
\lvert M^\lambda_{t\wedge \tau_{\alpha}} \rvert \leq e^{\frac{\lambda}{\sigma} \max(Z_{t\wedge \tau_{\alpha}}, 0) } \leq e^{\frac{\lambda \alpha}{\sigma}}\,,
$$
which allows to apply the dominated convergence theorem. Rearranging termes, we obtain the identity
$$
\mathbb{E}[e^{-(\frac{\lambda^2}{2} + \frac{\lambda \mu}{\sigma})\tau_{\alpha}}] = e^{-\frac{\lambda \alpha}{\sigma}}\,.
$$
This is almost the Laplace transform of $\tau_{\alpha}$, which we define for $\beta&amp;gt;0$ as $\mathbb{E}[e^{-\beta \tau_{\alpha}}]$. Since $\tau_{\alpha}$ is nonnegative, this Laplace transform fully characterises its distribution. Solving $\beta = \frac{\lambda^2}{2} + \frac{\lambda \mu}{\sigma}$ in terms of $\lambda$ yields $\lambda=-\frac{\mu}{\sigma} + \sqrt{\frac{\mu^2}{\sigma^2} + 2\beta}$ for $\lambda\geq 0$, i.e.
$$
\mathbb{E}[e^{-\beta \tau_{\alpha}}] = e^{\frac{\alpha \mu}{\sigma^2}\left(1 - \sqrt{1 + \frac{2\sigma^2 \beta}{\mu^2}}\right)} \,.
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides characterising the distribution, the Laplace transform is also useful to compute the moments. Indeed, by differentiating w.r.t. $\beta$, we have that
$$
-\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} \mathbb{E}[e^{-\beta \tau_{\alpha}}]\bigg|_{\beta=0} = \mathbb{E}[\tau_{\alpha}] = \frac{\alpha}{\mu} \,.
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all these calculations, let&amp;rsquo;s take a step back to reflect on what this result means. On average, a gambler reaches the critical threshold $\alpha=2$ after $\frac{\alpha}{\mu}=\frac{2}{0.63}\approx 3.17$ rounds. This is, perhaps quite surprisingly, very intuitive: if you start from €2 and loose on average $63$ cents each time you play, it should take you a bit more than 3 rounds to consume your initial €2. The above shows that this back-of-the-envelope calculation is exact in the continuous time Gaussian case. Moreover, this result is independent of the variance $\sigma^2$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nice-does-this-mean-that-i-can-play-thrice-at-the-cost-of-a-single-ticket-most-of-the-time&#34;&gt;Nice! Does this mean that I can play thrice at the cost of a single ticket most of the time?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not at all! It is important to make the distinction here between &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;median&lt;/em&gt; flight times. Intuitively, the distribution of flight time $\tau_{\alpha}$ should be quite asymmetrical around its mean: events where large gains are made early (e.g. first ticket yields €100) will result in very large flight times but remain quite rare, while events of &amp;ldquo;early crashes&amp;rdquo; (the few tickets are loosers) are much more frequent. Therefore, the median flight time, i.e. the majority of flight times are below it, should be less than the mean flight time, which is driven upwards by the &amp;ldquo;early luck&amp;rdquo; outliers. This type of distribution is called *right-skewed*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;flight-time-distribution-in-the-gaussian-case&#34;&gt;Flight time distribution in the Gaussian case&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expression of the Laplace transform $\mathbb{E}[e^{-\beta \tau_{\alpha}}]$ reveals that $\tau_{\alpha}$ follows an Inverse Gaussian distribution $IG\left(\frac{\alpha}{\mu}, \frac{\alpha^2}{\sigma^2}\right)$, the density of which is given by:
$$
p_{\tau_{\alpha}}(t) = \sqrt{\frac{\alpha^2}{2\pi \sigma^2 t^3}} \exp\left(-\frac{\left(\mu t - \alpha\right)^2}{2\sigma^2 t} \right)\,.
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We plot below this density for the Astro parameters ($\mu=0.63, \sigma=20.67, \alpha=2$), as well as the mean, the median, and the 5th, 25th, 75th and 95th percentiles. This distribution appears to be significantly right-skewed: even the 95th percentile is below the mean ($2.14$ versus $3.17$). In other words, according to the Gaussian approximation, it is really unlikely (less than 5% chance) that your flight time will be above 2 rounds, even though the mean flight time is above 3!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time, we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the flight time for the true Astro distribution, rather than under the Gaussian approximation. Closed-form expression of $\tau_{\alpha}$ are not available in this case, so simulations will prove handy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Markov Epidemic, a stochastic model for disease outbreak</title>
      <link>https://sauxpa.github.io/post/markov_epidemic/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sauxpa.github.io/post/markov_epidemic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I had the chance to work at ENS Cachan (now ENS Paris-Saclay) on statistical inference of networks based on how information propagates on them. Back then, we used to think in terms of networks of individuals subject to diseases that spread among neighbors, but more realistic application domains were thought to be computer malwares or viral marketing online. Obviously times have changed, and with several weeks of lockdown ahead, I thought about revisiting some of this work in the light of the recent events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article aims to describe a simple model to simulate random disease outbreaks and provide empirical evidence of the role of the network topology. In layman&amp;rsquo;s terms, the sparser the network, such as one describing a population under lockdown, the slower the propagation and the flatter the epidemic peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is intended to be fairly non-technical. All experiments shown are based on numerical models and do not claim to accurately represent real-life epidemics. All the code (a small Python library and a few notebooks) and more detailed mathematical explanations can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sauxpa/markov_epidemic&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-stochastic-models&#34;&gt;Why stochastic models?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of randomness to simulate complex systems is ubiquitous in mathematics, engineering and sciences in general. The general principle is to build an engine to generate plausible scenarios for the evolution of the system and sample multiple independent realisations to study the average or extreme behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we move on to such models, let us briefly recall some standard deterministic models in epidemiology. These are called compartmental models, because they model the evolution of a patient as going through successive stages, or compartments. Three popular variants of this idea are :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (&lt;strong&gt;SIR&lt;/strong&gt;) : all patients are initially susceptible, then can be infected, and then are removed from the system (either they are fully immune or they died),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (&lt;strong&gt;SIS&lt;/strong&gt;) : same but patients can be infected multiple times,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (&lt;strong&gt;SEIR&lt;/strong&gt;) : similar to SIR, with an extra compartment to model incubation time, during which patient are not yet infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under mean-field assumptions, i.e every individual in a large population shares the same likelihood of being infected by the rest, one can derive a deterministic system of differential equations describing the evolution of the fraction of infected individuals (see for example &lt;a href=&#34;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/130801&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kephart &amp;amp; White&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While such models are easy to understand and scale very well, they lack any description of the fine structure of the underlying social network. For example, what if the network contains highly social individuals that may act as hubs for the propagation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;markov-models&#34;&gt;Markov models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large class of popular stochastic models follow the &lt;strong&gt;Markov property&lt;/strong&gt; : the future evolution depends only on the present state, not the past history. While debatable, it allows for very flexible still numerically tractable models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a network &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;, that is a list of individuals (for instance 1, &amp;hellip;, N) and a list of pairs &lt;strong&gt;(i, j)&lt;/strong&gt; if individuals &lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;j&lt;/strong&gt; are neighbors. We will stick to this simple framework, but generalisation to weighted or directed networks is straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIS, SIR and SEIR can be naturally translated to the language of Markov processes by specifying the probability of transition between compartments. As is customary with continuous-time processes, we will actually define the transition rates rather than the probability (the two are related by the fact that transition events follow exponential distributions with parameters equal to the transition rates).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any individual, we assume a transition susceptible -&amp;gt; infected (or susceptible -&amp;gt; exposed in SEIR) at rate &lt;em&gt;proportional to the number of infected neighbors&lt;/em&gt;. This is quite natural: the more one is surrounded by infectious people, the riskier (note that here again there is room for more complicated designs by using a nonlinear aggregation function over the neighbors). The other transitions, (I-&amp;gt;S in SIS, I-&amp;gt;R in SIR, E-&amp;gt;I and I-&amp;gt;R in SEIR) are assumed to occur at constant rates (think of it as sick people being put in isolation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;experiments&#34;&gt;Experiments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sir&#34;&gt;SIR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First let us simulate the effect of a severe lockdown in SIR. For that, we compare the evolution of the number of cases for the same epidemic (same transition rates parameters) on two different regular networks :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sparse&lt;/strong&gt;: every node is connected to 10 other nodes,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dense&lt;/strong&gt;: every node is connected to 100 other nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the sparse scenario, a typical outbreak has a long plateau and a slow decrease, but a much smaller peak. In the dense case, almost all the population gets infected at a very early stage, creating a sharp peak, followed by a brutal, but slower decrease. The blue curve below is a typical lockdown strategic goal (flat and slow) while the red curve is more inline with a herd immunity viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be a bit more quantitative about the shape of the curve, one can try to regress a parametric form on it. In all experiments, sparse SIR leads to an approximately normal form while dense SIR is better fitted by a skewed shape such as lognormal. In other words, network sparsification is not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; about flattening the curve, but also controlling the slope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hub-effect&#34;&gt;Hub effect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another empirical effect is the &lt;em&gt;Hub effect&lt;/em&gt;, which is that highly connected nodes are critical for propagation. This typically happens in social networks (a few very popular nodes attract most of the attention) and can be described as &lt;strong&gt;preferential attachment networks&lt;/strong&gt;: starting from a small population of nodes, a larger network is grown by adding follower nodes that connect to the existing ones with probability proportional to the number of already existing neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of SIS over a preferential attachment network, we compare two outbreak scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a single patient zero, the one with the most neighbors,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 patient zeros, drawn at random (and therefore likely to be follower nodes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless a hub is targeted, the epidemic usually dies fast without reaching highly-connected zones, even with more initial patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As argued above, deterministic models à la Kephart &amp;amp; White can be seen as scaling limits of Markov models on regular networks, i.e when the local structure of the network is the same everywhere one looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is indeed empirically validated, see for example in the case of SIR and SIS below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is still a work-in-progress, made practically difficult by the number and quality of available data. One interesting direction would be to fit one of these models (for example SEIR) to the curve of tested cases of COVID-19 (which is typically noisy and subject to bias, including periodic bias, for instance during the week-ends when medical staff are not tested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, calibrating the model here means tuning the transition rates for S-&amp;gt;E, E-&amp;gt;I and I-&amp;gt;R such that the average curve over multiple epidemic scenarios resembles the most the collected data (for the example in the least squares sense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, one could investigate different types of representative networks to determine the ones that reproduce the best the observed trends, and use this as a starting point for further predictions (epidemic evolution, impact of lockdown exit&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very attractive aspect of stochastic simulation is the ability to perform numerical experiments. However, the topic of random processes over networks has been studied a lot on the theoretical side as well. A few selected references include :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nas.ewi.tudelft.nl/people/Piet/papers/IEEEToN_virusspread.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Virus Spreads in Networks&lt;/a&gt; by Van Mieghem et al., which formalises the definition of epidemic as a Markov process on the configuration space,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~maajg/infocom-worm.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Effect of Network Topology on the Spread of Epidemics&lt;/a&gt; by Massoulié et al., which exhibits a phase transition between short-lived and long-lived epidemics in terms of the transition rates and the adjacency spectral radius of the network,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.0060.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Got the Flu (or Mumps)? Check the Eigenvalue!&lt;/a&gt; in the same spirit, which relates spectral properties of the network to critical epidemic regimes in different models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
